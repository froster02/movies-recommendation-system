# Movies Recommendation System

A machine learning-based recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. This project utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide accurate and personalized movie recommendations.
Recommendation is based on Cosine Similarity and Weighted Average.

## Features

- üé• **Movie Recommendations**: Suggests movies based on user preferences, ratings, or similarity to other movies.
- üìä **Data Analysis**: Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the movie dataset.
- üß† **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Collaborative Filtering
  - Content-Based Filtering
- üìÇ **Data Handling**: Preprocesses and handles large datasets efficiently.
- üåê **User Interface (if applicable)**: A user-friendly interface for interacting with the recommendation system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of machine learning and data preprocessing.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/froster02/movies-recommendation-system.git
   cd movies-recommendation-system
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage

1. **Load Dataset**:
   - Place your movie dataset in the `data/` directory.
   - Update data paths in the scripts or notebooks as necessary.

2. **Run EDA**:
   - Open the EDA notebook in the `notebooks/` directory.
   - Visualize and preprocess the data.

3. **Train Model**:
   - Use the training notebook to build your recommendation model.
   - Save the trained model for later use.

4. **Make Recommendations**:
   - Run the prediction scripts to generate movie recommendations for users.

# Procedure

Step 1 : The dataset is used is downloaded from Kaggle.
         Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
       
Step 2 : Cleaned the dataset in data_preprocessing.ipynb file to remove the null values and to drop some fields.

Step 3 : Uploaded the dataset on to the [MongoDB Atlas Cluster]() client globally.

Step 4 : Fetch the data from MongoDB using NoSQL queries in Config.py file.

Step 5 : Imported the data into the main.py file to for operating.

Step 6 : Rendered the data onto the localhost using Flask framework.
